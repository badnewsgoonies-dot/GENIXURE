This is a new React + Vite + Tailwind UI scaffold for the He Is Coming â€” Loadout Builder.

Phase 1 includes the App shell with sidebars and tabs, and a Compendium page that loads items using BASE_URL-safe fetches and a simple search filter.

Run locally:

  pnpm i
  pnpm dev

Build for Netlify under a subpath:

  VITE_BASE=/ui/ pnpm build
