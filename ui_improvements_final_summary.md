# UI Improvements Summary - Battle Simulator

## ✅ Changes Successfully Applied

### 1. **Removed VS Badge** 🗑️
- Completely removed the animated "VS" badge between player and opponent previews
- Removed the CSS animation `@keyframes pulse-vs` that was causing the pulsing effect
- The battle preview section now flows directly from player to opponent without the distracting VS element

### 2. **Removed Max Turns Control** 🎛️  
- Removed the "Max Turns:" input field that allowed users to customize battle length
- Updated JavaScript to use a fixed value of 200 turns instead of reading from the input
- Simplified the controls section to only show "START BATTLE" and "Clear Log" buttons

### 3. **Replaced Emoji Icons with Real Stat Icons** 🖼️
- **Before**: Used generic emojis (⚔️, 🛡️, 🏆) throughout the interface
- **After**: Now uses actual game stat icons from the `assets/` folder:
  - `assets/attack.png` for attack/combat related elements
  - `assets/armor.png` for player/defensive elements  
  - `assets/health.png` for victory/summary elements

### 4. **Areas Where Stat Icons Were Applied** 📍
- **Main Title**: "BATTLE SIMULATION" now has attack icons on both sides
- **Player Section**: "PLAYER" uses armor icon (defensive/friendly)
- **Opponent Section**: "OPPONENT" uses attack icon (offensive/enemy)
- **Battle Log Messages**: All battle start and status messages use appropriate icons
- **Battle Summary**: "BATTLE SUMMARY" header uses health icon
- **Summary Sections**: Player stats use armor icon, opponent stats use attack icon
- **Victory Messages**: Victory status uses health icon

## 🎮 Result

The battle simulator now has a much cleaner, more professional appearance:
- **Cleaner Layout**: No distracting VS badge breaking up the flow
- **Streamlined Controls**: Simple two-button interface without customization complexity
- **Consistent Iconography**: Real game icons instead of generic emojis create visual cohesion
- **Fixed Battle Length**: Consistent 200-turn battles for predictable results
