# HeIsComing Project - Session Context & Progress Summary

## Project Overview
This is a browser-based game/simulation with a data-driven item effect system. The main goal is to migrate all item effects from hardcoded logic to a structured, maintainable JSON format with a corresponding effect engine.

## Current Progress Status ✅

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Turn Start Effects Implementation**
Successfully implemented Turn Start effects for weapons shown in user screenshots:

#### **Weapons Implemented:**
1. **Arcane Wand** - `weapons/arcane_wand`
   - Effect: "Can't attack. Turn Start: Deal 2 damage. Increase the damage by 1 for each tome equipped"
   - Uses: `deal_damage_per_tome` action, `no_attack` tag
   
2. **Bubblegloop Staff** - `weapons/bubblegloop_staff`
   - Effect: "Can't strike. Turn Start: Spend 1 speed to give the enemy 2 acid and 2 poison"
   - Uses: `spend_speed`, `give_enemy_status` actions, `no_strike` tag
   
3. **Lightning Rod** - `weapons/lightning_rod`
   - Effect: "Whenever you skip your strike when stunned, gain 2 attack"
   - Uses: `strike_skipped` trigger, `add_attack` action
   
4. **Lightning Whip** - `weapons/lightning_whip`
   - Effect: "Turn Start: If the enemy is stunned, gain 1 additional strike"
   - Uses: `turnStart` trigger, `gain_strikes` action, `enemy_stunned` condition

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Simulator Engine Updates**
Added new effect actions to `heic_sim.js`:
- `deal_damage_per_tome` - Calculates damage with tome bonus
- `spend_speed` - Spends speed points with validation
- `give_enemy_status` - Applies status effects to enemy
- Enhanced `strike_skipped` event trigger in strike function

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Previous System Migrations**
- **Edge Upgrades System** - All 16 edge upgrades migrated and functional
- **Rose System** - All rose items and effects migrated
- **Symphony System** - Symphony effects implemented
- **Combat Log Improvements** - Consistent icons and error fixes
- **Analysis Tab** - New UI tab showing side-by-side player loadouts

## Key Architecture Patterns

### **Data Structure Pattern:**
```json
{
  "effects": [
    {
      "trigger": "turnStart|battleStart|strike_skipped|etc",
      "condition": "optional_condition",
      "action": "action_name",
      "value": number,
      "status": "status_type"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Multi-Action Pattern:**
```json
{
  "effects": [
    {
      "trigger": "turnStart",
      "condition": "has_speed",
      "actions": [
        { "action": "spend_speed", "value": 1 },
        { "action": "give_enemy_status", "status": "acid", "value": 2 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Important Technical Details

### **Trigger Naming Convention:**
- Use `turnStart` (camelCase) not `turn_start` (snake_case)
- Use `battleStart` not `battle_start`
- Custom triggers like `strike_skipped` work as-is

### **Action Naming Convention:**
- Use existing actions when possible (`add_attack` not `gain_attack`)
- Actions are in snake_case: `deal_damage`, `add_armor`, etc.
- Check `heic_sim.js` EFFECT_ACTIONS object for available actions

### **Tags System:**
- `no_attack` - Prevents attacking
- `no_strike` - Prevents striking
- Item categories: `Tome`, `Food`, `Jewelry`, etc.

## Files Modified
- `details.json` - Item effect definitions
- `heic_sim.js` - Effect engine and actions
- `index.html` - UI improvements and Analysis tab

## Next Steps & Remaining Work

### **Immediate Priority:**
Continue implementing Turn Start effects from user screenshots:
- Standard items (Saffron Feather, Bramble Buckler, Ice Spikes, etc.)
- Cauldron items (Sugar Bomb, Toxic Cherry, etc.)

### **Items Needing Turn Start Effects:**
From the screenshots, many items still need structured effects:
- Saffron Feather: "Turn Start: Convert 1 speed to restore 2 health — at Gold: 2 for 2, at Diamond: 3 for 3"
- Bramble Buckler: "Turn Start: Convert 1 armor to 2 thorns"
- Ice Spikes: "Turn Start: If you have freeze, gain 5 thorns"
- And many more...

### **Testing & Validation:**
- Run simulation tests to ensure effects work correctly
- Test UI in browser to verify Analysis tab and combat log
- Validate edge cases and error handling

## How to Continue
1. User will provide more screenshots of items needing effects
2. Continue pattern of: analyze screenshot → implement structured effects → add missing actions → test
3. Focus on data-driven, maintainable solutions
4. Always use existing actions when possible
5. Test thoroughly before marking complete

## Test Scripts Available
- `test_turn_start_effects.js` - Validates effect data structure
- `test_sim_actions.js` - Checks simulator action availability
- Various debug scripts for specific systems

**Status:** Ready to continue with next batch of item effect implementations
**Last Updated:** Session ending after Turn Start weapon effects completion
