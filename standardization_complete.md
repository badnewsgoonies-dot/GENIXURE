# HeIsComing Codebase Standardization Completed

## Summary
Successfully completed a comprehensive standardization and cleanup of the HeIsComing codebase to remove legacy references, improve naming consistency, and modernize code organization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Legacy Reference Cleanup ✅
- Removed all "LEGACY" comment markers from code
- Updated "LEGACY ACTION" comments to descriptive functional comments
- Changed "Handle legacy if conditions" to "Handle condition formats (current and backward compatibility)"
- Removed outdated migration references while preserving functionality

### 2. Fighter Class Consistency Review ✅
After analysis, found that the Fighter class is already well-designed:
- Property names are consistent: `hp`, `atk`, `armor`, `speed`
- Helper methods match properties: `addAtk()`, `addArmor()`, `heal()`
- Data mapping is clean: `stats.attack` → `this.atk`, `stats.health` → `this.hp`
- No changes needed - system is already well-standardized

### 3. Effect System Terminology Standardization ✅
- Standardized comments to use consistent "actions" vs "effects" terminology
- Updated section headers: "COUNTDOWN EFFECTS" → "COUNTDOWN ACTIONS"
- Clarified that items have **effects** containing **actions** handled by **action handlers**
- Updated references from "Trigger the bomb's effects" to "Trigger item effects"
- Maintained backward compatibility while improving clarity

### 4. Documentation and Code Organization ✅
- Added clear section headers in EFFECT_ACTIONS:
  - `===== COUNTDOWN & AMPLIFICATION ACTIONS =====`
  - `===== BASIC STAT MODIFICATION ACTIONS =====`
  - `===== DIRECT STAT HELPERS =====`
  - `===== STAT & STATUS INTERACTION ACTIONS =====`
- Updated section names: "NEW ACTIONS for pending migrations" → "EXTENDED ACTION HANDLERS"
- Updated "MISSING ACTIONS" → "ADDITIONAL ACTION HANDLERS"
- Improved code documentation to reflect current data-driven architecture

### 5. Validation and Testing ✅
- All tests pass after standardization changes
- `test_triggers_fix.js`: All trigger tests working correctly
- `test_poison.js`: Effect system functioning properly
- No regressions introduced by the standardization work
- Existing functionality preserved

## Technical Impact

### Before Standardization
```javascript
// LEGACY ACTIONS (for backward compatibility)
add_armor: ({ self, value }) => self.addArmor(value),

// LEGACY ACTION (use convert_status_to_stat instead)
convert_acid_to_attack: ({ self, log, value }) => {

// Handle legacy if conditions
conditionsMet = checkCondition(effect.if, effectCtx);
```

### After Standardization  
```javascript
// Simple stat modification actions
add_armor: ({ self, value }) => self.addArmor(value),

// Convert acid status to attack stat
convert_acid_to_attack: ({ self, log, value }) => {

// Handle condition formats (current and backward compatibility)
conditionsMet = checkCondition(effect.if, effectCtx);
```

## Key Benefits
1. **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed outdated legacy markers and migration references
2. **Better Documentation**: Clear section headers and descriptive comments
3. **Consistent Terminology**: Standardized effect/action/handler language throughout
4. **Maintained Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved
5. **Improved Maintainability**: Code is easier to understand and navigate

## Files Modified
- `heic_sim.js` - Main simulation engine with effect system
- `standardization_plan.md` - Planning document (created)

## Validation Results
- ✅ All trigger tests pass (Exposed, Wounded from non-strike sources)
- ✅ Poison effects working correctly
- ✅ No breaking changes introduced
- ✅ Effect system fully functional
- ✅ Battle simulation produces same results

The HeIsComing codebase is now significantly cleaner, better organized, and more maintainable while preserving all existing functionality.
