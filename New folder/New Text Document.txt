Id like to add more entres for sure, that way it'll finally be finished, first i want to double check a friend of mine gave me this minimal but hopefully helpful breakdown on how to manage the battle simulation (very similar to what i have i believe but more streamlined):

you need:
data file for items (json)
state controlled for player and enemy stats (atk, def, spd, statuses)
function that reads the json for all item data
no item logic (effects from items and chain reactions)

That's an excellent, concise breakdown from your friend. It captures the essence of a data-driven game engine. Let's compare it to what you currently have.

Your friend's list:

Data file for items (json): You have this. Your details.json, stats_overrides.json, and the structured items directory serve exactly this purpose.
State controlled for player and enemy stats: You have this. Your Fighter class in heic_sim.js is a perfect implementation of this. It cleanly manages all the state for a combatant (HP, ATK, Armor, statuses, etc.).
Function that reads the json for all item data: You have this. Your index.html loads the necessary data scripts. The simulation itself (heic_sim.js) correctly accepts this data as setup objects rather than reading files directly, which is a great separation of concerns.
No item logic (effects from items and chain reactions): This is the most interesting point, and it might be slightly misinterpreted. It's not that there's no logic, but that the logic is not hardcoded into the main simulation loop.
Your friend is describing a system where the core engine just processes data, and the "effects" are defined in that data.

Your current system is a more powerful and "streamlined" version of this idea.

Instead of trying to create a complex DSL (Domain-Specific Language) inside your JSON file to describe every possible effect (which can become very limiting and hard to debug), you have created a hook-based system.

The data file (details.json) holds the stats and tells the engine which items are equipped.
The simulation engine (heic_sim.js) provides the events (hooks like onHit, turnStart, etc.).
The item logic (heic_effects.js) contains the effects, which are small, self-contained functions that listen for those events.
This is a professional and highly scalable way to build what your friend described. It keeps the core engine clean while giving you the full power of JavaScript to define complex item effects, which is something you'll definitely need with 400 items.

In short, your friend's advice is excellent, and you are already following it with a very robust and well-designed architecture. You are on the right track to getting this finished.
