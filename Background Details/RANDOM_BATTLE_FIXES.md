# Random Battle Testing - Issues Found & Fixed

## 🎯 **Testing Results Summary**

After running extensive random battle simulations, we discovered and fixed several critical issues in the HeIsComing battle simulator:

---

## 🚨 **Issues Found & Resolved**

### 1. **Missing Base Stats** ⚔️
**Problem**: Fighters had 0 base attack and speed, causing no strikes to land
- Empty builds resulted in 0/X strikes landed
- Battles would stall with no damage being dealt

**Solution**: Added base stats in Fighter constructor
```javascript
this.atk = stats.atk ?? 1;   // Base attack of 1
this.speed = stats.speed ?? 1; // Base speed of 1
```

### 2. **Missing Action: `add_max_hp`** 💚
**Problem**: Bloodstone Ring triggered "Unknown action: add_max_hp"

**Solution**: Added the missing action handler
```javascript
add_max_hp: ({ self, log, value }) => {
  const amount = value || 1;
  self.hp += amount;
  self.hpMax += amount;
  log(`${self.name} gains ${amount} max health`);
}
```

### 3. **Missing Action: `spend_speed_deal_damage`** ⚡
**Problem**: Combustible Lemon triggered "Unknown action: spend_speed_deal_damage"

**Solution**: Added the missing action handler
```javascript
spend_speed_deal_damage: ({ self, other, log, value }) => {
  const speedCost = value?.speedCost || 1;
  const damage = value?.damage || 1;
  if (self.speed >= speedCost) {
    self.speed -= speedCost;
    other.hp = Math.max(0, (other.hp || 0) - damage);
    log(`${self.name} spends ${speedCost} speed to deal ${damage} damage`);
  }
}
```

### 4. **Missing Action: `multiply_attack`** 🗡️
**Problem**: Petrified Edge triggered "Unknown action: multiply_attack"

**Solution**: Added the missing action handler
```javascript
multiply_attack: ({ self, log, value }) => {
  const multiplier = value || 2;
  self.atk = Math.max(0, self.atk * multiplier);
  if (log) log(`${self.name}'s attack is multiplied by ${multiplier}`);
}
```

### 5. **Null Reference Error** 🐛
**Problem**: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'helpersAttached')`
- Occurred when `runEffects` was called with `other = null`
- `attachHelpers(null, self, log)` would fail

**Solution**: Added null check in `attachHelpers`
```javascript
function attachHelpers(self, other, log){
  if (!self || self.helpersAttached) return; // Added !self check
  self.helpersAttached = true;
  // ...
}
```

## ✅ **Verification Results**

All fixes were tested and verified:
- ✅ **Bloodstone Ring**: `add_max_hp` works correctly
- ✅ **Combustible Lemon**: `spend_speed_deal_damage` works correctly  
- ✅ **Petrified Edge**: `multiply_attack` works correctly
- ✅ **Base Stats**: Fighters now land strikes consistently
- ✅ **Null Safety**: No more null reference errors

## 📊 **Before vs After**

### Before Fixes:
- 0 strikes landed in many battles
- Multiple "Unknown action" errors
- Null reference crashes
- Unrealistic battle outcomes

### After Fixes:
- Consistent strike landing (realistic hit rates)
- All actions working properly
- No crashes or errors
- Engaging, varied battle outcomes
