Effect Cards (dev-ready)

Each card has: what it does, when it fires, exact resolution, edge cases, and a small DSL/pseudocode block you can drop into your engine.

1) Freeze (status)

What: Halves the attacker’s ATK part (rounded down) on the next incoming strike(s).
When: During Strike resolution, if the defender has Freeze stacks.
Resolution:

Compute attacker’s atk_part → set atk_part = floor(atk_part/2).

Consume exactly 1 Freeze stack for that strike.

On-hit damage is not halved.
Edge notes: Multi-strike attacks consume 1 stack per strike until stacks = 0.

DSL:

{ "status": "freeze", "on_defense": [
  ["halve_atk_part", 1], ["consume", 1]
]}


Test: Attacker ATK 3 vs defender Freeze 1 → HP damage from ATK part = 1; on-hit +1 still applies → total 2.

2) Thorns (status)

What: Reflect fixed damage to the attacker when they hit you.
When: After the attacker’s damage (ATK → Armor/HP and any on-hit) is applied.
Resolution:

Deal thorns to attacker (Armor then HP).

If owner was struck this turn, remove all Thorns at end of turn.
Edge notes: Thorns is a status; it can be reduced/transferred by effects at Turn Start if it persisted (i.e., owner wasn’t struck last turn).

DSL:

{ "status": "thorns", "on_hit_taken": [["reflect", "thorns"]],
  "end_of_turn": [["if_struck_then_clear", "thorns"]] }


Test: Owner Thorns 2, gets hit → attacker takes 2 back; End of Turn: thorns → 0.

3) Corroded Bone (item)

What: Converts enemy Health into their Armor.
When: Battle Start.
Resolution: Enemy loses floor(50% of current HP); enemy gains that same amount as Armor.

DSL:

{ "battle_start": [["enemy_hp_to_enemy_armor_pct", 50]] }


Test: Enemy 20 HP → enemy HP 10, enemy Armor +10.

4) Blood Sausage (food)

What: Front-load healing in ticks.
When: Battle Start.
Resolution: Heal 5 total HP, applied as five 1-HP ticks (stop at max HP).

DSL:

{ "battle_start": [["self_hp_plus", 1],["self_hp_plus",1],["self_hp_plus",1],["self_hp_plus",1],["self_hp_plus",1]] }


Test: 18/20 → 20/20 (last 3 ticks cap out); 15/22 → 20/22 (exact 5).

5) Sour Cherry (food)

What: Opening chip.
When: Battle Start.
Resolution: Deal 1 damage twice (two separate pings).

DSL:

{ "battle_start": [["enemy_hp_minus",1], ["enemy_hp_minus",1]] }


Test: Defender Armor 0 → HP −2; with Armor 1 → first ping clears Armor, second ping −1 HP.

6) Iceblock Shield (item)

What: Armor + Freeze stacks (defensive opener).
When: Battle Start.
Resolution: Gain +8 Armor and +2 Freeze (Freeze consumed per incoming strike).

DSL:

{ "battle_start": [["gain_armor",8], ["gain_freeze",2]] }


Test: First two enemy strikes have halved ATK parts.

7) Horned Helm (item)

What: Starter Thorns.
When: Battle Start.
Resolution: Gain +1 Thorns.

DSL:

{ "battle_start": [["gain_thorns",1]] }


Test: First time you get struck this turn, attacker takes 1; thorns then clear at end of that turn.

8) Boomstick (weapon)

What: Fixed on-hit chip in addition to the attack.
When: On Hit (after ATK part applies).
Resolution: Apply normal ATK part damage (Armor → HP), then apply +1 HP damage as on-hit.
Freeze interaction: halved ATK part, on-hit +1 unaffected.

DSL:

{ "on_hit": [["onhit_extra_damage",1]] }


Test: Attacker ATK 2 vs Freeze 1 → ATK part 1 to Armor/HP + on-hit 1 to HP.

9) “Healing Earrings” (every-other turn)

What: Periodic heal.
When: End of even-numbered turns (owner’s turns).
Resolution: Heal 1 HP (cap at max).
Note: If your canonical timing is different (e.g., Turn Start on even turns), flip the hook—but keep the cadence.

DSL (one option):

{ "end_of_turn": [["if_even_turn_then", ["self_hp_plus",1]]] }


Test: End of Turn 2, 4, 6… +1 HP each time.

10) Rusty Ring (item)

What: Acid only; no stats.
When: Battle Start.
Resolution: Give enemy +1 Acid. (We don’t tick acid here—status system handles it.)

DSL:

{ "battle_start": [["enemy_gain_status","acid",1]] }


Acid tick (engine rule): At Start of your turn, lose Armor = Acid stacks.

11) Assault Greaves (item)

What: Retaliation ping when you’re damaged.
When: Immediately after you take damage (any Armor/HP loss).
Resolution: Deal 1 damage to the attacker (Armor then HP). (No ATK from this item.)

DSL:

{ "flags": [["on_damaged_deal_damage",1]] }


Test: You take 3 to Armor → attacker takes 1. If they also took Thorns, total back-damage is Thorns + 1.

12) Sanguine Imp (item)

What: Small tempo loop.
When: Turn Start (owner).
Resolution: Deal 1 to enemy and Heal 1 self (cap at max).

DSL:

{ "turn_start": [["enemy_hp_minus",1], ["self_hp_plus",1]] }


Test: Net +1 swing per owner turn (ignores armor only for the heal side; damage still routes through armor if you model it as “damage” not “HP minus”).

13) Poison (status)

What: HP damage gated by zero Armor.
When: Start of your turn.
Resolution: If armor == 0, take Poison stacks as HP damage, then remove 1 stack.

DSL (engine rule):

{ "turn_start": [["if_armor_zero_then", ["hp_minus","poison_stacks"]], ["reduce_status","poison",1]] }

14) Acid (status)

What: Armor shred.
When: Start of your turn.
Resolution: Lose Armor equal to Acid stacks (down to 0; no direct HP damage).

DSL (engine rule):

{ "turn_start": [["armor_minus","acid_stacks"]] }

15) Exposed / Wounded (conditions)

Exposed: Triggers once the first time your Armor hits 0 this battle.
Wounded: Triggers once the first time your HP ≤ 50% max.

DSL (engine flags):

{ "on_armor_to_zero_first_time": [["trigger","exposed"]],
  "on_hp_to_half_first_time":   [["trigger","wounded"]] }

Glue Rules (so these effects compose correctly)

Order inside a strike: Freeze → Armor soak → HP → On-Hit → Thorns → Exposed/Wounded → Death check.

Freeze stacks: consume per incoming strike; do not auto-decay at turn end unless your spec says so (we’re using “consumed on use”).

Thorns cleanup: end of turn only if owner was struck.

Status targeting: Thorns counts as a status; any “reduce a random status” on Turn Start can hit Thorns if it persisted.

Stat sanity: Treat >20 on base stats (ATK/ARMOR/SPEED/HP) as invalid—reject or clamp per your policy.

Want me to keep going? I can add more from the compendium (e.g., Ironstone Sandals temp ATK if Armor, Featherweight Helmet spend-armor → Speed/ATK, Spiritual Balance check Speed == ATK, Rock Candy/Ore Heart stone synergies, etc.).

Yeah, keep it rolling.
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 29s

You got it. Here’s the next batch — tight, dev-ready cards only for effects we’ve already used/mentioned from your compendium. Same format: What/When/Resolution + tiny DSL + a quick sanity test. If anything here doesn’t match your canonical text, flag it and I’ll adjust the card.

Effect Cards — Batch 2
16) Ironstone Sandals (item)

What: Temporary attack while you have Armor.
When: Turn Start (owner).
Resolution: If armor > 0, gain +2 temp ATK for this turn only.

DSL

{ "turn_start": [["temp_gain_atk_if_armor", 2]] }

17) Featherweight Helmet (item)

What: Trade Armor for tempo.
When: Battle Start (owner).
Resolution: Spend 2 Armor. If paid in full → gain +3 Speed and +1 ATK.

DSL

{ "battle_start": [["spend_armor_gain_speed_atk", [2,3,1]]] }

Resolution: If Speed == ATK at this moment, gain +3 ATK.

DSL

{ "battle_start": [["if_equal", ["speed","atk"], ["gain_atk",3]]] }


Test: ATK 2, Speed 2 at start → ATK becomes 5. If Speed changes later, no retroactive loss.

19) Rock Candy (item)

What: Big defensive opener.
When: Battle Start.
Resolution: Gain a large amount of Armor (your data had fixed values; if it varies by condition like “HP full”, encode as a conditional).
Dev note: If your canonical rule is “15 Armor (30 if full HP)”, model it explicitly.

DSL (example)

{ "battle_start": [
  ["if_equal", ["hp","hp_max"], ["gain_armor",30]],
  ["else", ["gain_armor",15]]
] }


Test: At 20/20 → +30 Armor; at 19/20 → +15.

DSL

{ "on_hit": [["if_enemy_armor_zero_then", ["self_hp_plus_from_atk"]]] }


Test: ATK 5; hit takes last 1 Armor then 4 HP → at resolution enemy armor == 0 → heal 5.

22) Bejeweled Blade (weapon)

What: Jewelry scaling.
When: Battle Start (or passive calc at equip — choose one; Battle Start is simplest).
Resolution: Gain +2 ATK for each jewelry-tagged item equipped.

DSL

Test: 2 jewelry pieces → +4 ATK.

23) Swiftstrike Cloak (item)

Resolution: If your Speed > enemy Speed at start, gain +1 additional strike on your first turn.

DSL

{ "battle_start": [["if_greater", ["self.speed","enemy.speed"], ["gain_extra_strikes_first_turn", 1]]] }


Test: You act first with 2 total strikes on turn 1; later turns are single strikes unless other effects apply.

24) Friendship Bracelet (item)

What: Enemy ATK down.
When: Battle Start (enemy-targeting).
Resolution: Enemy loses −1 ATK for the entire battle.

DSL

{ "battle_start": [["enemy_gain_atk", -1]] }

25) Energy Drain (item)

What: Speed swing before anything else.
When: Pre (explicitly before any other item triggers).
Resolution: If you have less Speed than enemy, steal 5 Speed from them (self.speed +=5, enemy.speed -=5).

DSL

{ "pre": [["if_less", ["self.speed","enemy.speed"], ["steal_speed", 5]]] }


Test: You 1 Speed vs enemy 2 → you 6, enemy −3 before Battle Start effects.

26) Ironstone Armor (item)

What: Damage reduction while armored.
When: During Strike (defender passive).
Resolution: If defender has Armor, reduce the attacker’s ATK part (or post-calc strike) by 2.
Dev call: Apply reduction to ATK part before armor soak so it doesn’t “double count”.

DSL

{ "passive_defense": [["if_have_armor_then_reduce_incoming_atkpart", 2]] }


Test: Incoming ATK part 5 vs Ironstone defender with Armor → ATK part becomes 3, then armor soak 3, HP hit 0.

27) Bramble Buckler (item)

What: Armor → Thorns converter.
When: Turn Start (owner).
Resolution: Convert 1 Armor into +2 Thorns. (Consume armor first, then add Thorns.)

DSL

{ "turn_start": [["convert_armor_to_thorns", [1, 2]]] }

DSL

{ "turn_start": [["if_enemy_armor_zero_then", ["enemy_hp_minus", 3]]] }

Resolution: If hp < hp_max, heal +3.

DSL

{ "turn_start": [["if_wounded_heal", 3]] }

30) Brittlebark Bow (weapon)

What: Strong early ATK that decays.
When: On Hit (attacker).
Resolution: After some number of strikes, lose ATK (your data suggests a decrement after N hits; encode N and step as data).

DSL (parametric)

{ "on_hit": [["increment_strike_counter",1], ["if_counter_ge", ["strikes",N], ["gain_atk",-K]]] }


Test: Start +4 ATK; after 3 hits, −1 ATK (repeat if defined).

Glue/Engine Updates for these

Add pre-phase handling before Battle Start for items like Energy Drain.

Add passive defense hook (defender-side) for Ironstone Armor that modifies incoming ATK part before soak.

Add per-turn extra-strikes capability with scoping (e.g., “first turn only” from Swiftstrike Cloak).

Add tag counters (stone, jewelry) for Rock Candy/Ore Heart/Bejeweled Blade.

Confirm Lifesteal Scythe uses final ATK (base + temp) for heal; if it should be base only, cap it.

Want me to keep rolling through more (e.g., Dashmaster’s Dagger, Twin Blade, Stillwater Pearl / Riptide synergy, Exposed-trigger items)? Or pause here and wire these into the engine first?

Resolution: Gain 2 Freeze (no Armor in your compendium entry).
DSL

{ "battle_start": [["enemy_gain_status","acid",1]] }

Engine notes from wiring-in

Added pre phase before Battle Start.

Implemented extra strikes (first-turn scoped and weapon-scoped).

Added riptide_triggers_max guard so Stillwater Pearl can bump the per-turn Riptide trigger count.

Added first-strike armor-removed listener for Blackbriar Gauntlet.

Added tag counters (jewelry/stone).

Status targeting: Thorns flagged as a status, so CSL (Clearspring set) can reduce/transfer it if it persisted.

If you want, I can run a sanity battle that intentionally lights up a handful of these (e.g., Dagger + Cloak vs. Featherweight + Gauntlet + Opal) to visually confirm all hooks are firing in order.

Totally fair. I’ve removed the >20 base-stat clamp everywhere—no filtering in the draw, no clamping in the sim, no hidden caps. Everything now reads straight from your compendium/overrides exactly as-is.
I left only the two explicit fixes you asked for:

Assault Greaves: ATK 0; effect = “when you take damage, deal 1.”

Rusty Ring: no stats; Battle Start → give enemy 1 Acid.

If you want those reverted too, say so and I’ll flip them back. Otherwise, rolling on with more effect cards.

Effect Cards — Batch 4 (from your compendium)
56) Acid Mutation (item)

What: Acid-fueled temp ATK.
When: Battle Start (apply Acid) and Strike turns (temp scaling).

DSL

{ "battle_start": [["enemy_gain_status_from_value","acid",["self.speed"]]] }

58) Arcane Bell (item)

What: Countdown accelerator (Symphony).
When: Battle Start.
Resolution: Decrease all countdowns by 1 (yours and/or global—model as yours unless spec says global).
DSL

{ "battle_start": [["decrease_all_countdowns",1]], "tags":["symphony"] }
